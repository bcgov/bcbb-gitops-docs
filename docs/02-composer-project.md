## Continuous Integration

[Docker Scaffold](https://github.com/drupalwxt/docker-scaffold) has been integrated into the Composer project to facilitate continuous integration.

* https://github.com/bcgov/MFIN-Data-Catalogue/actions

> **Note**: Currently only a basic site installation is performed (see next steps).
